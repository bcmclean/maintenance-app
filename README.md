UBCO Maintenance App

The UBCO Maintenance Reporting app provides a means by which students, faculty, and visitors can communicate maintenance needs quickly to the maintenance personnel, and maintenance personnel can evaluate and respond more efficiently. This is accomplished by providing an interface via which a users can make a report with or without signing in, and maintenance personnel have access to a real-time list of reported requests.

For the first main task, ​reporting an issue anonymously​, the user is not required to login. By not logging in, the user’s maintenance report will not be available to be reviewed at a later time, but will still be recorded on the maintenance personnel task management activity. Reporting an issue as a signed in user follows the same “New Report” process, but the resultant request is additionally available for later review to check in on the status of the request.
